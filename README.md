Week 1 ( 27/10/2024 to 2/11/2024) 
We had finalized with our project idea and began to install all the software requirements in all our systems.

Project Idea: "MoodMate" – A Mood-Based Music & Activity Recommender
MoodMate is an app that recommends personalized music playlists and activities (like reading, exercise, or relaxation techniques) based on the user’s current mood. Users can select their mood, and the app will suggest matching songs, podcasts, or activities to either boost their mood or help them relax.

Features:
Mood Selection: Users choose from different moods (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed, etc.).
Music & Activity Recommendations: Based on the selected mood, the app suggests playlists from platforms like Spotify or simple activities (e.g., reading, meditation, exercise).
Mood Tracker: A simple mood-tracking feature where users can log their daily moods and see trends over time.
Minimalist UI: A clean, simple interface that makes the app easy to use and navigate.
